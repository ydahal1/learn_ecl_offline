# HPCC Systems

HPCC Systems is a mature platform that has been heavily used in commercial applications for almost two decades, predating the development of Hadoop. Created by LexisNexis® Risk Solutions, an innovative pioneer in big data processing, and open source for nearly a decade now, HPCC Systems features a vibrant development community that continues to push the boundaries of Big Data.

This powerful, versatile platform makes it easier for developers to see the data they’re working with and manipulate it as needed. Flexible information delivery makes it easier for your clients to query and find the data they need — and it runs analysis and queries faster than other platforms such as SQL or Hadoop.
