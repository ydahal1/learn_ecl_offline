# About Us

The HPCC Systems Solution Lab group is part of [LexisNexis Risk Solutions](https://risk.lexisnexis.com),
a [RELX](https://www.relx.com) company.

We work closely with organizations interested in the HPCC Systems big data platform.
By educating newcomers on the advantages of the platform, or by demonstrating those
advantages through proof of concept solutions tailored to a customer's specific needs,
we strive to show the world how HPCC Systems can make processing big data manageable.

In addition to simply demonstrating the HPCC Systems platform's native capabilities,
we also develop tools and libraries that extend those capabilities in new directions.
We firmly believe in Open Source Software, so all of our public tools are available on Github.

Our group directly supports the education community through semester-long university classes and shorter, more focused hands-on workshops. Our intern program is heavily populated by attendees of these classes and workshops.
