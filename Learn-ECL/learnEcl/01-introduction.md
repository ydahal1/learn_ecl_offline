# ECL

ECL - Enterprise Control Language is designed to handle and manipulate immense datasets which makes it a prefect language to solve big data problems. ECL can be used for both ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) and querying data. ECL is a declarative language which allows processing big data without the need of programmer being involved with details and in-depth of imperative decisions.

## ECL vs SQL

ECL and SQL can both be used to query a relational database. Following tables displays similar features between ECL and SQL.

## Language Highlights

- ECL is not case sensitive language, but it is recommended to use uppercase for reserved words
- White spaces are ignored, but it is strongly recommended to use white space for clarity and readability
- Declarative Programming Language, which means you specifies what needs to be done rather than how to do it
- Source-to-source compiler
- ECL code translated to C++ that is compiled to shared libraries and executed within a custom frame-work

Please refer [ECL syntax](./syntax.md) to learn about ECL standards. Or,
[jump right into coding](./output.md) and skip all the introductions.
